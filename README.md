# LinkedIn-profile-photo-analysis
This code utilises the Microsoft Computer Vision API to analyse LinkedIn profile photos, perform basic sentiment analysis and make some minor modifications.
It requires a Microsoft Azure subscription key and endpoint as user input. 

This was just an exploratory project I did for fun - any suggestions on how it could be improved would be appreciated!
